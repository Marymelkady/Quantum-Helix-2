    <h1>Prevention and Early Detection</h1>
    <p>Preventive measures can help reduce the risk of developing cancer. These include lifestyle changes, such as avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in regular physical activity, protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure, and practicing safe sex. Vaccines are also available to prevent certain types of cancers, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent liver cancer. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Regular screenings, such as mammograms for breast cancer and colonoscopies for colorectal cancer, can detect cancer at an early stage when it's most treatable. It's important to be aware of any changes in the body and seek medical attention if any unusual symptoms persist. Additionally, individuals with a family history of cancer may benefit from genetic counseling and testing to assess their risk and take appropriate measures for prevention and early detection.</p>

    <h1>Treatment Options</h1>
    <p>Treatment options for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy, stem cell transplant, and precision medicine. The choice of treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the individual's overall health. Surgery involves the removal of the tumor and surrounding tissues. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body. Immunotherapy helps the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Targeted therapy focuses on specific abnormalities within cancer cells. Hormone therapy blocks or removes hormones to stop or slow the growth of certain cancers. Stem cell transplants replace diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells. Precision medicine uses genetic testing to identify specific mutations in cancer cells and tailor treatment accordingly. In many cases, a combination of treatments may be used to achieve the best results. It's important for patients to discuss treatment options with their healthcare team to make informed decisions.</p>

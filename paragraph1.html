    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>This project applies innovative mathematical approaches to detect and treat cancer through gene editing nanobots. It focuses on cancer stem cells, which drive tumour growth. Initially, stem cells are classified as ancestral or special cases using microfluidic chips and AI modelling of samples. Ancestral cells undergo standard DNA extraction for analysis. DNA sequencing employs two algorithms - a rapid circular loop method with O(1) time complexity, and a slightly slower O(n) approach. Both aim to minimise fragmentation and accelerate the process. Extensive testing on over 120 samples validated their efficiency at minimising time. The core technique then utilises a specialised coding program to analyse sequenced DNA. It determines editing steps by recognizing a unique “UDRL” algorithm within the sequence responsible for cancer mutations. Remarkably, this program is designed to restore corrupted DNA to a normal state by identifying and modifying these mutations. Finally, the transformed gene is reintroduced into tumours using gene editing nanobots. As these nanobots have an affinity for cancerous cells based on gene concentrations, they facilitate the change of cancer cells back to a normal phenotype. This holds particular promise for early-stage cancers during proliferation when transformation may be most effective. Overall, this project combines mathematical techniques like optimised sequencing algorithms, specialised coding analysis, and targeted nanotherapeutics. It aims to revolutionise cancer detection and treatment through precise identification and correction of cancer-causing genetic errors.</p>

               Cancer is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

                Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

                Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). 

                Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.

                Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don't grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.
